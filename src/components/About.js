                Hello! Iâ€™m Dariel Mera, a Junior Software Developer passionate about creating innovative solutions.
                I thrive on solving challenging problems and continuously learning new technologies. I enjoy both
                front-end and back-end development, combining technical skills with creativity to build intuitive
                user interfaces and efficient server-side logic. I value teamwork and believe the best solutions
                come from diverse perspectives. In my free time, I explore the latest tech trends and AI, which keep
                me connected with the vibrant tech community.
